# Welcome to afeblesc.github.io!
Personal website for @afeblesc stuff 
This is just a place where I intend to place different things I found interesting. If you ended up here it's probably from twitter. If not, you can follow me at @trafek87

I'm just pretending to use github as a host for my website. If you find something easily improvable, please, let me know. Thanks!
